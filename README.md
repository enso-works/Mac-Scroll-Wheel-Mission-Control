# Scroll Wheel Mission Control

**Use any cheap mouse to switch desktops on your Mac.** Hold the scroll wheel and drag left or right to move one desktop. Drag up for Mission Control, down for App Exposé. A plain click stays a normal middle click.

Trackpads have swipe gestures for this. Regular mice don't, and the apps that add it usually want a subscription or a paid license after a trial. This app is free, small, and open source. It has no analytics, and it makes no network requests unless you turn on the optional update check.

> [!TIP]
> **Free forever. $0, no trial, no license key, no "pro" version, no ads, no tracking.**
> If you found this while looking for a free alternative to Mac Mouse Fix, SteerMouse, BetterTouchTool or a vendor mouse app just to switch desktops, you're in the right place. See [the promise](#free-forever).

## Features

- **Drag to switch desktops.** Hold the scroll wheel and drag left or right. Each drag moves exactly one desktop, so you never fly past the one you want.
- **Drag up or down for Mission Control and App Exposé**, like a three-finger swipe on a trackpad. Each direction can also be set to Show Desktop or nothing.
- **Middle click still works.** A plain wheel click stays a normal middle click (open links in new tabs). You can make it open Mission Control or App Exposé instead, or do nothing.
- **Natural or standard direction.** Natural moves the screen with your hand, like pushing it aside. Standard matches the arrow keys.
- **Adjustable drag distance.** Choose how far you have to drag before it counts.
- **Per-app rules.** Turn the app off completely for Blender and other 3D tools (Blender is set up out of the box), or keep gestures but always pass the plain click through.
- **Optional update check.** Off by default. When on, it tells you when a new version is out. It never downloads or installs anything by itself.
- **Menu bar app.** No Dock icon. Pause it from the menu bar whenever you like.
- **Launch at login**, using the standard macOS login items.
- **Universal binary.** Runs natively on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs with macOS 13 Ventura or later.

## Install

### Download

1. **[Download ScrollWheelMissionControl.dmg](https://github.com/enso-works/mac-scroll-wheel-mission-control/releases/latest/download/ScrollWheelMissionControl.dmg)** (always the latest version). A `.zip` is also on the [Releases page](https://github.com/enso-works/mac-scroll-wheel-mission-control/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Scroll Wheel Mission Control** onto the **Applications** folder.
3. The first time you open it, **right-click the app and choose Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog.

> **Why the extra step?** Apple charges developers $99 a year to notarize apps. This is a free hobby project, so it isn't notarized, and macOS says it is "from an unidentified developer". Right-click > Open tells macOS you trust it. You only do this once. If you'd rather not trust a download, [build it yourself](#build-from-source): it takes about a minute.
>
> On macOS 15 Sequoia and later, right-click > Open may not show the Open button. In that case, try to open the app once, then go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway**.

### Build it yourself

```sh
git clone https://github.com/enso-works/mac-scroll-wheel-mission-control.git
cd mac-scroll-wheel-mission-control
make install
```

## First launch

The app needs **Accessibility** permission so it can see scroll wheel clicks and press the desktop-switching shortcuts for you.

1. Open the app. Its settings window appears, together with a macOS prompt.
2. Click **Open System Settings** in the prompt, or **Open Settings** in the app.
3. In **Privacy & Security > Accessibility**, turn on **Scroll Wheel Mission Control**.
4. The settings window turns green: **Accessibility access granted**. No restart needed.
5. Optional: turn on **Launch at login**.

## How to use it

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Hold the wheel, drag **right** | Go to the desktop on the **left** (natural) or **right** (standard) |
| Hold the wheel, drag **left** | Go to the desktop on the **right** (natural) or **left** (standard) |
| Hold the wheel, drag **up** | Open Mission Control (configurable) |
| Hold the wheel, drag **down** | Show the current app's windows, App Exposé (configurable) |
| Click the wheel | Normal middle click (configurable) |

Each drag does one thing. To move further, release the wheel and drag again. Whichever direction you drag furthest wins, so a slightly diagonal drag still counts as left, right, up or down.

**Don't have multiple desktops yet?** Drag up to open Mission Control, then click the **+** at the top right of the screen to add one.

## Settings

Open **Settings...** from the menu bar icon, or open the app again from Spotlight or Launchpad.

</p>

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enable scroll wheel gestures | Master on/off switch. Also available in the menu bar. | On |
| Launch at login | Start automatically when you log in | Off |
| Drag left / right | Switch desktop. **Natural**: drag right to reveal the desktop on the left. **Standard**: drag right to go right. | Natural |
| Drag up | Mission Control, App Exposé, Show Desktop, or nothing | Mission Control |
| Drag down | Mission Control, App Exposé, Show Desktop, or nothing | App Exposé |
| Wheel click | Normal middle click, Mission Control, App Exposé, or nothing | Normal middle click |
| Drag distance | How far (in points) you must drag before it counts | 30 pt |
| App rules | Per-app behavior, see below | Blender: Off |
| Check for updates automatically | Ask GitHub once a day whether a new version is out | Off |

**App rules:** click **Add App** to choose a running app, or pick one from your Applications folder, then choose a mode:

- **Off:** the app gets the middle button completely untouched. Use this for 3D and design tools that use middle-drag (Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya, Fusion 360, Unity, Unreal).
- **Gestures only:** dragging still triggers gestures, but a plain click always reaches the app as a normal middle click, whatever **Wheel click** is set to.

**Updates:** with automatic checks on, the menu bar menu and the settings window show "Version X is available" with a **Download** button. **Check Now** checks immediately, even with automatic checks off.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Nothing happens when I click or drag</b></summary>

- Check that the menu bar icon is filled in. An outlined icon means the app is paused.
- Open Settings and check that Accessibility access shows as **granted**.
- If you updated or rebuilt the app, macOS may be holding on to the old permission. In **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**, select Scroll Wheel Mission Control, remove it with **–**, then open the app again and allow it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Mission Control opens, but dragging doesn't switch desktops</b></summary>

The app switches desktops by pressing the standard **Ctrl + Left / Ctrl + Right** shortcuts for you. Make sure they're turned on:

**System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Mission Control**, then tick **Move left a space** and **Move right a space**.

Also make sure you actually have more than one desktop (see [How to use it](#how-to-use-it)).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Every wheel click triggers two things</b></summary>

You probably also assigned a mouse button to Mission Control in macOS itself. Go to **System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Shortcuts...** and set the Mission Control mouse shortcut back to **–**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Middle click stopped working in my browser or editor</b></summary>

By default a plain wheel click passes through as a normal middle click. If it doesn't:

- Check that **Wheel click** is set to **Normal middle click**, or
- Add that app under **App rules** with the mode **Gestures only** (keeps dragging) or **Off** (the app gets the middle button untouched).

Middle-button *dragging* inside apps is used for gestures. If an app needs middle-drag, set it to **Off**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS says the app is damaged or can't be opened</b></summary>

That is the Gatekeeper quarantine flag on a downloaded, un-notarized app. Run this once in Terminal:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Scroll Wheel Mission Control.app"
```

</details>

## Uninstall

1. Click the menu bar icon and choose **Quit**.
2. Delete **Scroll Wheel Mission Control.app** from Applications.
3. Optional cleanup:
   - Remove it from **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**.
   - Delete its settings file:
     ```sh
     defaults delete io.github.enso-works.ScrollWheelMissionControl
     ```

## Build from source

Requirements: macOS 13 or later and the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). No Xcode project and no dependencies are needed.

```sh
make app       # universal .app in build/
make install   # build and copy to /Applications
make dmg       # release DMG and zip in dist/
make art       # re-render the icon and README artwork
make screenshots  # re-render the settings window screenshots
make clean
```

By default the app is ad-hoc signed. If you have an Apple Development certificate, sign with it so the Accessibility permission survives rebuilds:

```sh
SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" make install
```

To list your certificates, run `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`.

## How it works

1. A [`CGEventTap`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/1454426-cgeventtapcreate) listens only for **middle mouse button** events (down, drag, up). Normal clicks, the scroll wheel itself, and the keyboard are never touched.
2. On button down it checks the frontmost app. If that app's rule is **Off**, or the app is paused, the events pass through unchanged.
3. Once you drag past the threshold, the dominant direction decides the action. Left/right posts **Ctrl + Left/Right**, the same shortcut macOS already uses for "Move left/right a space". Up/down posts the Mission Control (**Ctrl + Up**), App Exposé (**Ctrl + Down**) or Show Desktop (**F11**) shortcut. Then it ignores the rest of that drag.
4. If you release without dragging, it runs the wheel click action.
5. The original middle-button events are swallowed so apps don't also react to them. For a normal middle click, the click is re-sent tagged, so it passes through.

Because it drives the system's own shortcuts, desktops switch with the standard macOS animation, and there are no private APIs to break on OS updates.

## Privacy

- No analytics or telemetry.
- No network access, with one optional exception: if you turn on **Check for updates automatically** (off by default) or click **Check Now**, the app sends one anonymous HTTPS request to the public GitHub API for the latest release version. Nothing about you, your Mac or your settings is sent, and it never downloads or installs anything by itself.
- Accessibility permission is used only to see middle mouse button events and to post the desktop shortcuts. Nothing is logged or stored except your settings.
- The code is small enough to read in a few minutes. Please do.

## Free forever

This project will always be **free of charge and open source**:

- **$0.** No trial period, no license key, no paid tier, no "unlock" purchase, no subscription.
- **No ads, no telemetry, no account.** The app doesn't connect to the internet unless you turn on the optional update check.
- **Every feature is included.** Nothing is held back for a paid version, because there is no paid version.
- **MIT licensed.** Even if this repository disappeared or the maintainer changed their mind, anyone can fork the code and keep it free. The license makes that permanent.

If a website asks you to pay for "Scroll Wheel Mission Control", it isn't this project. The only official downloads are on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/enso-works/mac-scroll-wheel-mission-control/releases).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How do I switch desktops (Spaces) on a Mac with a normal mouse?</b></summary>

macOS only has swipe gestures for trackpads and Magic Mouse. With this app installed, hold the scroll wheel and drag left or right to move one desktop. Without any app, you can use the keyboard shortcuts **Ctrl + Left Arrow** and **Ctrl + Right Arrow**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I open Mission Control with the middle mouse button?</b></summary>

Install this app, hold the scroll wheel and drag up. You can also set a plain wheel click to open Mission Control. macOS also has a built-in option (**System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Shortcuts... > Mission Control > Mouse Button 3**), but it can't be turned off per app, and it can't switch desktops by dragging.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is this a free alternative to Mac Mouse Fix?</b></summary>

For switching desktops and opening Mission Control, yes. Mac Mouse Fix is a well-made app with many more features (smooth scrolling, button remapping and more), and it asks for payment after its free trial, which is fair for what it offers. If all you want is to move between desktops with a basic mouse, this app does that for free, with no trial.

The same goes for SteerMouse, BetterTouchTool, USB Overdrive and similar tools. They're great if you need everything they do. If you only need desktop switching, you don't have to pay for it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work with my mouse?</b></summary>

Any mouse with a clickable scroll wheel (middle button) works: cheap USB mice, Bluetooth mice, Logitech, Microsoft, Razer and so on. No drivers or vendor software are needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will it break middle-click in Blender or my browser?</b></summary>

No. A plain wheel click stays a normal middle click by default, so opening links in new tabs keeps working. Blender is set to **Off** under App rules, so orbit and pan work as usual. Add any other app that uses middle-drag the same way.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is it safe? Why does it need Accessibility permission?</b></summary>

macOS requires Accessibility permission for any app that reads mouse buttons system-wide or presses shortcuts for you. The app only listens to middle-button events and doesn't connect to the internet unless you turn on the optional update check. The code is short and public, so you can check exactly what it does, or [build it yourself](#build-from-source).

</details>
